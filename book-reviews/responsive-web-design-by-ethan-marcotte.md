# Responsive Web Design
by Ethan Marcotte

## Summary
Resoponsive Web Design is a future-proof way of designing for the web. There are three simple ingredients needed for the foundation of a responsive front-end layout:

1. *A flexible*, grid-based layout,
2. *Flexible images and media*, and
3. *Media queries*, a module from the CSS3 specification.

These three ingredients creat a more felixible, responsive approach to designing for the web.

Best Practices: Flexible content boxes, (%, not px), padding and margins (em, not px) typesetting (em, not px), fluid images and other media (max-width: 100% or width: 100% in IE6), design for breakpoints, not for devices â€“ but do test with actual devices in hand.

## Biggest Take Away

My biggest take away was a better understanding of why responsive design is important and some of the best practices for designing mobile (small-screen) first. There were very valuable tips and code examples that explained the uses of many of the things we see on the web today.
