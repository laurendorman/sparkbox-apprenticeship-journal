# Getting Real
by 37 Signals

## Summary
Getting Real is a very opinionated guide to "cutting the fat" from your design, development and project management process. It suggests that focusing only on the issues at hand and what is absolutely necessary will result in a lean, budget-friendly product. The book recommends saying *no* to feature requests while paying attention to what users say they *don't need*. 37 Signals advises on hiring small, interface design, coding less, pricing, promotion and even post-launch tactics.

## Biggest Take Away
My biggest take away from Getting Real was to think thorougly through what's important and what isn't. It is a good introduction to cutting down on big upfront design, something that I struggle with. I often think about everything all at once, when I should be focusing on smaller areas and working from there. This book is a great motivater to stop thinking so large.
