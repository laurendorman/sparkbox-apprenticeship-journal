# Week 10

## Birthday, Birthday!
My birthday was on Sunday and we celebrated by having banana splits on Monday at the office. There were a lot of March birthdays, so the birthday treats/desserts have packed on a few pounds this month.

## More Game of Life
I began writing tests for all of the things that I thought the game should do. Most of my tests are failing right now and I am struggling a bit with getting it working. I hope to pair a bit more with people around the office to get things working. I had the game running at one point (not properly, by any means), but now I am at a place where I need to refactor and rethink my logic in order to get things working again. I am in the early stages of Game of Life, but I hope to get it working over the next few weeks.

## Dribbble Meetup
Dayton had it's first Dribbble Meetup at the Sparkbox office in the chill area and the big conference room. There was mascot drawing challenge with a prize of a ticket to see [Dan Mall][] in October at the Build Right Marker Series. St. (Papa) John's was the winner, because who can deny pizza? It was really cool to meet designers in the area.
