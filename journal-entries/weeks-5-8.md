# Weeks 5-8
I'm a little behind on journals so I am spending this week getting caught up, trying to remember all that I can from the past few weeks.

## Girl Scouts Workshop
When I volunteered to facilitate the GSWO Workshop, I had no idea I would be brought on board to teach a portion of the workshop and build an example site. A good part of my past few weeks went towards creating slides and styling a Beyonc√© fansite.

After working through two weeks of prep, I helped facilitate the GSWO workshop and was also given the opportunity to write a guest post for Sparkbox on [Divshot][].

## Ruby
I worked through the [FizzBuzz Kata][] in Ruby, which I am fairly happy with considering my [starting point][]. I also worked through a great deal of [Yahtzee Kata][], which was a bit more difficult but rewarding. I believe that my Yahtzee Kata could use some refactoring and could be cleaned up a bit more. It is something that I plan to revisit in the near future.

## Build Responsively with Ben Callahan
We were introducted to Responsive Web Design Sparkbox style through Ben's Build Responsively Workshop, which was held at the Sparkbox office for the apprentices. I wrote a few notes on the workshop [here][].

## First Formal Review
Leading up to my first formal review I was extremely nervous. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but once I began presenting my work and realized how low-pressure the **formal** review was, my nerves began to ease. I gained some valuable feedback about some of the things I need to work on moving forward, which was to gain a better understanding of Ruby syntax and create a workflow/environment that works for me and makes me a more productive programmer. As a result of this feedback, I set some [goals for March][].
