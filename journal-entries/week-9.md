# Week 9

## The Start of JavaScript
Getting started with JavaScript was an adjustment. I found myself wanting to write JavaScript the way that I write Ruby and it isn't quite as easy or forgiving. JavaScript is something that I feel is extremely important for me to learn. I spent this week working through a couple of JavaScript courses on Treehouse, which were extremely helpful with the language switch.

I haven't quite figured out how to write JavaScript in an Object-Oriented way, but there are a few courses out there that I plan to dive into over the next few weeks that will hopefully help me along the way.

## Game of Life
Just as I began diving into JavaScript, I was put back on the Ruby track. We were introduced to the Game of Life and are expected to make work through it over the next month. I found it challenging to get started on Game of Life. I paired with a few people around the office to help get my ideas off the ground, but I am still finding kinks working through it.

I plan to spend the next few weeks working through the Game of Life and trying to find a balance between that and JavaScript.

## Foundry Post
I spent some time this week getting ideas out for my very first [Foundry][] post. I decided to write about being a big city transplant in a small techtown. My hope is to tell my story and provide a few pointers to those in a similar situation moving to any city â€“ big or small.
