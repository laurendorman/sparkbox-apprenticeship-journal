# Week 1
My first week as an Apprentice at Sparkbox is in the bag and I already feel that I am learning at a much quicker pace than I was on my own. I've been working with Git on a daily basis, began customizing my shell, gained a few pingpong skills and had my fair share of quite amazing food. I am excited for what the future holds.

## Git
Cromwell gave us a intro to Git on the second day of the apprenticeship. His theory was that if you understand the inner workings of Git, it is easier to use and is far less intimidating. Knowing what Git is used for and how easy it makes version control, working collaboratively and deployment – this proves true.

During the whiteboard session, I learned that Git isn't all that scary. Not everything clicked at first, but after working through the Code School lessons, everything Cromwell taught us made sense. I've already gotten to the point that I know the necessary commands to clone, add to, commit to and push a repository. In fact, I'm now on a 5 day streak. I have a goal to reach a 100 day streak during my apprenticeship.

## Customizing the Shell & Creating dotfiles
Bouncing around from Meetup to Meetup in Chicago, I had always heard about dotfiles, but didn't fully understand how they were used and how important they actually are. On Thursday, Adam gave us a talk on how to begin customizing your shell and told us about the benefits of creating and storing your dotfiles.

Dotfiles are used to store application settings and preferences, aliases for commands and a lot of other cool things. I still have a lot to learn about the benefits and capabilities of dotfiles. I am only scratching the surface with a few aliases for now, but I would really like to learn more about further customizing my shell.

## Pingpong
When I say pingpong is a big deal at Sparkbox, pingpong is a big deal at Sparkbox. Most games are played in two teams of 2 and get quite intense. I've played a few games of ping-volley-ball-pong, but I'm in need of a bit more practice before I will be up for a serious match.

Drew helped with my serve, which in turn helped with my over all playing capabilities. I can get extremely competitive when it comes to any type of game, so I'm sure volleypong will be no different.

## The Ever So Glorious Food
I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Friday lunches are served up family style and the food is amazing. How can you top grilled chicken and steak, a baked potato bar, asparagus, salad and sweets? The catch is that *we'll* have to top it from here on out (we'll be assisting with Friday lunches).

Dan, Kasey and I have created a calendar where we've scheduled out our dessert and meal plan rotation, although we all plan to share Friday's duties of cooking and cleaning. I look forward to seeing what meal ideas brew from it and showing off my kitchen skills.

## Closing Remarks
It's a great feeling to wake up in the morning and feel excitement for what lies ahead. Everyday before I walk into the Sparkbox office I get this feeling. I am both nervous and determined. This journey isn't for the faint of heart and I am gaining confidence the more I learn.
