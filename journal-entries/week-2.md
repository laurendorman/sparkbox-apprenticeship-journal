 # Week 2
My second week was a challenge. We began learning Ruby and it has been pretty tough. I don't expect to learn it overnight, but I do have very high hopes of learning it fast. Hopefully that a-ha moment comes along any day now. I am glad that I am starting to grasp the basic concepts, which counts for a whole lot.
