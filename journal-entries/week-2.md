# Week 2
My second week was a challenge. We began learning Ruby and it has been pretty tough. I don't expect to learn it overnight, but I do have very high hopes of learning it fast. Hopefully that a-ha moment hits me and I'll be programming in no time. I am glad that I am starting to grasp the basic concepts, which counts for a whole lot.

## Ruby Koans
Working through [Ruby Koans][] was a weeklong adventure. I knew that working my way through them would be a challenge, but I learned a lot along the way. The koans helped me understand the Ruby syntax. I now have basic understanding of how to *write Ruby*, or at least read it. I believe that the fill-in-the-blank approach is a good way to begin learning a coding language. It helps you identify language patterns and implement them.

## Ruby Bits 1
I began working through [Ruby Bits 1][] and it was a bit more demanding than the koans. While the koans helped a good bit with understanding the syntax of Ruby, Ruby Bits 1 helped me understand how Ruby actually works. The course covers the guts and core of the Ruby language and a big help in gaining fundamental knowledge.

## Getting Real
I am about halfway through [Getting Real][] by 37 Signals. It is a friendly reminder to narrow your focus and to center your work around only the necessary things. Strip away all of the nice-to-haves and build the things that matter most. It has opened my eyes a bit more to agile development and why it is needed.

## Closing Remarks
After diving straight into Ruby, I am happy that we are starting where it hurts. I believe that it will help me as I begin learning new languages. I am excited for what's to come and I look forward to falling down and getting back up again.
