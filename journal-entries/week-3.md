# Week 3
My third week is down and I am feeling a bit more confident in Ruby. I began learning a bit more about [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)][] concepts and was introduced to a new book, [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby][]. I planned and managed an entire Friday lunch and worked through a few more online courses.

## Sparkbox 2015 Update
The week started with attending the Sparkbox 2015 Update, where I learned a lot about the companies goals, values, highs and lows. Drew hosted an award ceremony called The Groanies, where people were given gag gifts in a number of quite hilarious categories. It was a great experience and I even got a chance to meet Ethan, who works remotely in Milwaukee and has a lot of [swag][].


## More Ruby
This week, I chomped through [Ruby Bits 2][] and began playing [Ruby Warriors][]. Ruby Bits 2 was advanced, but allowed me to understand how to define, find and call methods as well as the use of *self*. I began Ruby Warriors and made it to Level 5, where I got stuck, but began pairing with Yock in order to understand how to work through the problem. I found that learning more about OOP would be indeed helpful when moving forward in the game. I did not save my progress this time around, as I just wanted to get familiar with the game and understand how to solve the problems at hand. I will begin working through Ruby Warriors again at the top of next week.


## Object-Oriented Programming
I've always heard the term "Object-Oriented Programming" being tossed around, but never really had a good understanding of what it truly meant. I now know that OOP is all about breaking down problems to the tiniest pieces to allow for simple, clean, understandable code. I am not sure how to apply this to a project yet, but I hope to learn a bit more once I dive into reading Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby.

## Friday Lunch
Nikki was out for the week and asked if one of the Apprentices would be willing to take on the responsibility of handling Friday Lunch for the team. I gladly obliged and put together a menu for a chicken and vegetarian gyro bar with sides of tabbouleh and hummus with chips. It was a hit in the office! And I certainly couldn't have done it without Dan and Kasey.

## Closing Remarks
All in all, I am happy with my progress this week. I am glad to finally be getting the hang of the Ruby language. While I may have a ways to go, I am pleased with my competence.
