## Objects – What do they do?
* Collect/manage state.
* Changes over time.

# What do objects include?
* String - Characters.
* Array - List of objects.
* Number - Value/number.
* Hash - Key/Value.

## How can they be used?
! – Mutate State.
? - No side affects, used for further information - yes/no.

## Class – What exactly are they?
* Are templates that describe something.
* Return information and logically organizes things.
* If you create a class, it makes a new object.
